# sdproject4
This project analyzes a car advertisement dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about car listings, including price, model year, condition, odometer reading, and more. The code reads the dataset, explores its properties, and creates visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots. The visualizations help understand the distribution of car prices and the relationship between price and odometer reading. The analysis is presented through an interactive web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to explore the data and toggle the display of raw information. Overall, this project provides insights into car advertisement trends and patterns, aiding in decision-making for buyers, sellers, and automotive enthusiasts.
