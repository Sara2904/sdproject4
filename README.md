# Car Advertisement Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a car advertisement dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about car listings, including price, model year, condition, odometer reading, and more. The code reads the dataset, explores its properties, and creates visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots. The visualizations help understand the distribution of car prices and the relationship between price and odometer reading. The analysis is presented through an interactive web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to explore the data and toggle the display of raw information. Overall, this project provides insights into car advertisement trends and patterns, aiding in decision-making for buyers, sellers, and automotive enthusiasts.

## How to Run the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Sara2904/sdproject4

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd sdproject4

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirement.txt

4. Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py

5. Once the application is running, it will provide a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501). Open the URL in your web browser to access the application.

Please note that you may need to modify the file paths or make additional configurations based on your local setup.

## Student Comment 

Hello Yulia! First of all, thank you so much for your observations, I tried to follow all the recommendations. However, I would like to tell you that it was a long process to get my app to work. I spent almost 7 days with two of the tutors trying to find the problem until finally, Friday night, we were able to solve it. I'm telling you this because it's the reason why the '.streamlit' and 'project_env' files are not in the GitHub repository. Apparently, both files were conflicting with the local configuration. Deleting them was the only way to make my app work. Is there any other way I can send them to you or give you access for review? I understand they should be there, but if I add them back, the web application would stop working. I'm looking forward to your instructions. Thank you so much again!
